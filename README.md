In this hands-on exercise, youâ€™ll work with the Coral Cloud Resorts sample app. Coral Cloud 
Resort is a fictional beach resort that leverages data and artificial intelligence to provide highly 
personalized experiences to its guests. Your task is to create a customer service agent to assist 
guests in learning more about their available experiences. You will explore their pre-built 
capabilities powered by standard actions, and you can choose to extend them with custom 
actions built with Flow, Apex, and prompts. Get started by enabling Generative AI in your Org.
